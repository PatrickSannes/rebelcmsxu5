Modifications to model:

- Consider versioning in IEntity
Possibly rename IEntity to be IEntityRevision, but do need a way of knowing what is the 'current' and what is
a hand-loaded revision by choice

- Can EVERYTHING deal in an IEntityRevision? Is that safe? What notion of versioning would we ever need 
on a user?

- Need a way for an entity provider to advertise whether it supports versioning or not


APN 2010 08 11: Attribute Schema system:
- I haven't yet implemented attribute grouping into AttributeSchemaDefinition.
Attribute grouping is analogous to 'tabs' in document types of Umbraco 4.x
It's tempting to implement a group construct, and even to introduce a XAML-like dot notation on the
attribute names in any Xml seriaization of the data, but note to self: even attributes should be entities
since that way we can inherently have hierarchy in the attribute system. A grouping of attributes is 
just an inherent hierarchy of entities on another entity. Welcome to the matrix.
HOWEVER we need to be careful about how it's implemented: as a consumer of the UF, it would be confusing if
we just made ITypedAttribute inherit IEntity because the properties may get very confusing. Check out XElement vs
XAttribute. After all, an Attribute has a single Value, that is its purpose. An entity's "value" is its collection
of attributes.


APN 2010 09 08: Attribute schema is now done. ITypedAttributes are IEntityVertex(es), basically my solution to the problem
of having attributes on attributes (if attributes were to be entities which had the Attributes collection) was to create
a third abstraction type, ITypedEntity. IEntity does not specify an Attributes collection. By inheriting from IEntityVertex
rather than ITypedEntityVertex we have hierarchical attributes without them having attributes too.
